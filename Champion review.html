My review: Danny the champion of the world is a book about a boy who doesn't have a mother.Till he was 9 he and his father led a normal,rather fun life.Then after his 9th birthday once while sleeping he found out a about a  very big secret of his seemingly law-abiding father.Read the book to find out.<br>
